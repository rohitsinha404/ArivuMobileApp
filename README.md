<h1> Idea Descr: </h1>
Arivu is a web and app based ed-tech platform which focuses on enhancing and overcoming obstacles in rural education. This will especially work on improving practical knowledge, communication skills and will work towards overall socio-economic development of children.
Main features of Arivu:
<ol>

The site is extremely easy to use and is equipped with beginner-friendly walkthroughs so that all students whether they know working with computer or not, can also access all of the resources and can excel in studies. 

<h2><li>Garland of Guidance: </li></h2>
We offer an instant mentor support network for study, doubts, career advice, future guidance etc. Students can connect with mentor via video-call/chat. 
The video-calling feature is also implemented by team BRO Coders so that it can also be made easier to use and goevrnment also need not to depend on third party apps.
Government can also harness the video calling feature to host their programs/sessions/webinars which students can access easily.

<h2><li>Interactive Learning: </li></h2>
Arivu is loaded with loads of fun and interactive games which is based on their course like projectile motion etc.
Also Arivu is equipped with Virtual Labs so that students who are not able to access good scientific labs, can also work and get hands-on experience. 
This will promote a deeper conceptual understanding of topics and how they are/can be applied in real world scenario.

<h2><li> AI powered chat-bot for doubt support: </h2></li>
With the integration of AI powered chat-bot, students can resolve their doubts anytime, anywhere 24x7. This feature is designed to enhance the learning experience, making sure that no doubt is left in mind.

<h2><li>Accessibility for All: </li></h2>
Not all students have access to personal devices or reliable internet connectivity. To tackle this Arivu has established certified centers in colleges and schools. These trusted spaces offer computer labs, ensuring that every student can benefit from our platform.
Arivu also offers a helpline number. Through this service, students can access doubt support and audio lectures, ensuring that educational resources are available to all, regardless of their technological resources. 

<h2><li>Mascot-based learning for Early Education:</li></h2>
Mascot based learning in the early education gives a personal touch to the education process. This will also ensure greater involvement of students.
